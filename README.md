A queue worth lining up for.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'box-office'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install box-office

## Usage

Set up a new box office instance

This auto generates at least three seperate queue instances that
play a role in keeping the box office open

  1. Standby
  2. Reserved
  3. Fulfilled

You can override any of these names in the configuration

```ruby
showing = Box::Office.showing(name: "Jurassic Park", showings: 5)
```

Push values to the standby list

```ruby
showing.standby.push %w(Alan Ellie)
# OR
showing << %w(Alan Ellie)
```

Start popping values from standby into the reserved queue

```ruby
showing.reserve
```

With a block you can get the returned queue and the members

Utilizing the block will also take care of unlocking the queue to allow
future processes to utilize it.

```ruby
showing.reserve do |queue, members|
  # Do something with the queue and the members
end
```

When the show is over, just pop the members from the reserved queue.
If you've setup tracking of fulfilled, the member will be pushed to
the fulfilled queue.

```ruby
showing.fulfill(showing.reserved, %(Alan))
```

Access any queue instance in the box office
```ruby
showing.standby
showing.reserved
showing.fulfilled
```

### Queue

List all members

```ruby
showing.standby.members
```

Override the default limit of 100

```ruby
showing.standby.members(limit: 1_000)
```

Get length of the queue

```ruby
showing.standby.length
```

Empty the queue

```ruby
showing.standby.clear
```
